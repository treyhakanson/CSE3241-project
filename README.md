## Database Recovery

If the `sql.db` file gets corrupted, the SQL in the following file can be executed to create a new instance of the database:

```
sql/dumb.sql
```

This is a SQL file, not a database file, and can be opened from any text editor.

## User Guide

The user guide is in a separate file from this README, and can be found in:

```
UserGuide.pdf
